## Lighthouse Batch Reporter

Supports executing [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) analysis over a number of sites in sequence and
generating a summary report including all of their scores. Scores are calculated from the
average score between Performance, PWA, Accessibility and Best Practice and SEO sections.

Also writes out a `json` report summary for each site and optionally an `html` report too.

## CLI

Install globally

    npm install lighthouse-batch -g

Example usage

    lighthouse-batch -s https://airhorner.com,https://housing.com

This will generate the following files under the `/report/lighthouse` folder.

    airhorner_com.report.json // Full results for airhorner.com
    housing_com.report.json   // Full results from housing.com
    summary.json              // Summary of results with scores out of 100

If you also want html reports include the `--html` option.

    airhorner_com.report.html // Full html results for airhorner.com
    housing_com.report.html   // Full html results for airhorner.com
